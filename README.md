# Course Bookings Java
## MVP
To Create a course reservations API utilising three models:
  - Course with name, location and star rating
  - Booking with a date on which it was created
  - Customer with name, location and age

Each booking should have an associated customer who created it and the course to which the customer is booked on to.
Each customer should be capable of having multiple bookings. Each course should be capable of having multiple bookings.

## Set Up
- clone the repository onto local machine

- Open the project in IDE such as IntelliJ

- In a terminal create database with name 'courseservice'

- Run CoursebookingsApplication.java (this will run the DataLoader component to populate the database)
