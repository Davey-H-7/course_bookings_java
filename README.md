# Course Bookings Java
## MVP
To Create a course reservations API utilising three models:
  - Course with name, location and star rating
  - Booking with a date on which it was created
  - Customer with name, location and age

Each booking should have an assosciated customer who created it and the course to which the customer is booked on to

## Set Up
- clone the repository onto local machine

- Open the project in IDE such as IntelliJ

- In a terminal create database with name 'courseservice'

- Run CoursebookingsApplication.java (this will run the DataLoader component to populate the database)
